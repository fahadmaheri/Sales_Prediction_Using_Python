# Sales Prediction Using Python

This project demonstrates how to build a simple machine learning model using Linear Regression to predict sales based on historical sales data. The model is trained and tested using a dataset containing features like `QUANTITYORDERED`, `PRICEEACH`, and `ORDERLINENUMBER`, and the target variable is `SALES`.

## Key Features:
- Data preprocessing to handle missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with summary statistics
- Linear Regression model training using `scikit-learn`
- Model evaluation using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Visualization of predicted vs actual sales

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
